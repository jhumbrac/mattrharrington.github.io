		<h1>NYC HEADSHOT AND PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
		<p>You are awesome. You are unique. Your headshot should convey as much. 

		<p>From actors and singers to business professionals and entrepreneurs, from Facebook to LinkedIn to your own personal website, the headshot is the calling card of the digital age.</p>

		<p>Every one of my sessions is an organic, tailor-made experience, with a focus on keeping things fun and relaxed. I shoot using a combination of natural and studio lights. Most of my shoots happen in and around Park Slope, though I am happy to travel if you've got a dream spot in mind. Drop me a line for more info, to set up a consultation, or to make an appointment!</p>

		<p>Headshot sessions are $350 and include unlimited digital images. Sessions tend to run about two to three hours. Make-up/hair/styling is paid separately on the day of the shoot. Inquire for pricing.</p>
